      <h2>Why discussions on trans people are one-sided</h2>
      <p>
        I was scrolling through reddit when I came across another thread from
        r/Libertarian on
        <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/efhtwn/tennessee_introduces_bill_requiring_school_sports/"
          >trans athletes</a
        >. This is not the first time I've seen this discussion play out
        recently. It seems to be all the rage to try to justify discrimination
        against trans people by playing them off as aggressors against helpless
        cis women, either in the bathroom or on the track.
      </p>
      <p>
        In these discussions, I see patterns of framing the discussion in one
        way only: focusing on those who are born as men. Men who transition to
        women dominating in their sports field; men who transition to women
        invading women's bathrooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is missing is the discussion of the other side, F-to-M trans men.
        If you restrict bathrooms to sex assigned at birth, what about trans men
        who look very masculine using these bathrooms? If you restrict athletics
        to sex assigned at birth, what about trans men actively taking
        testosterone competing with cis women?
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course there are nuanced debates that can be had about these sort of
        edge cases, but I find interesting about these discussions is the
        framing. In many of the arguments the focus is on the male, or assigned
        male at birth. You can see this also in the debates around
        homosexuality. Globally,
        <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619887785"
          >homosexual men are disliked more than homosexual women</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p class="text-bold">
        I think the root cause of all of this is a visceral dislike that some
        men feel towards others who break masculine gender norms.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe this drives much of the discriminatory or homophobic behavior
        towards gay men and trans women, and is the reason why we get such
        one-sided debates around trans issues. F-to-M trans athletes competing
        against cis women is not something that comes up often because it
        doesn't touch at this root cause. M-to-F trans athletes is a hot issue
        because it does.
