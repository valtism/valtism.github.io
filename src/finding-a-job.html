        Finding a Job
      </h2>
      <p class="my-4">
        At the end of 2019, over the span of a couple of weeks, I suddenly found
        myself without a house, without a partner and without a job. The next
        day I had a one-way ticket from Australia to Europe, where my family
        lives, and resolve to find a job working abroad.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        I have always wanted to work abroad, but life has a way of tying you to
        a place, whether that be family, a job, a relationship. My circumstances
        were all coincidental, but together they offered something
        unique—freedom from being tied to a place.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        Starting in December, I began applying for jobs. Most of these
        applications I sent were to the
        <a

          href="https://news.ycombinator.com/ask"
          >Who is Hiring?</a
        >
        threads on Hacker News. I found my previous job here, and I find that a
        lot of the companies who post here are a better cultural fit for me than
        those who don't. (I also have an extreme distaste for LinkedIn, and
        after begrudgingly reactivating my profile there I got nothing except
        for a huge uptick in spam in my inbox).
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        All in all, I spent 3 months applying for jobs. Here's a breakdown of my
        applications:
      </p>

        class="shadow-2xl mb-8"
      />
      <p class="my-4">
        The majority of my applications were flat out rejections. This wasn't
        helped by the fact that as a foreigner I also need a visa to work. This
        is especially true in the US where H1-B visas are notoriously difficult
        to obtain. I would often be flat-out rejected even though as an
        Australian I was eligible for the much easier E-3 visa.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        Even worse than the rejections were the lack of responses. It was
        particularly demoralising to spend a lot of time on an application only
        to receive silence. I would like to think that if a company is looking
        for a candidate they should at least reply with a rejection out of
        respect.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        By the end of January, I had not had many positive responses at all. I
        think this was probably due to December and January being not
        particularly good times to be applying for a job (who wants to be
        looking for new hires with Christmas around the corner?). I was feeling
        the pressure because I only had 90 days I could stay in the EU without a
        visa. I decided to start branching out and looking at an agent, or
        someone who could help find me a job.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        I saw a link to
        <a class="border-b-2 border-indigo-400" href="http://triplebyte.com"
          >Triplebyte</a
        >
        on Hacker News and decided to give it a go. It's a site for vetting
        candidates technically so it doesn't have to happen for every
        application.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        I went into it not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the
        process. As someone who is self-taught, interviews that are heavily
        focused on data structures and algorithms can be very difficult.
        Triplebyte seems to focus less on this, and I was accepted into the
        program.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        In the end, I got 3 onsites. 2 in San Francisco, and 1 in Munich. One in
        SF was from one of the three companies who contacted me through
        Triplebye, and the other two were from my own applications. I got offers
        from all 3 and went with the offer from Triplebye. I'll be starting
        there soon.
